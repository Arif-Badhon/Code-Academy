#Write a function called unique_english_letters that takes the string word as a parameter. 
#The function should return the total number of unique letters in the string. 
#Uppercase and lowercase letters should be counted as different letters.

#Weâ€™ve given you a list of every uppercase and lower case letter in the English alphabet. It will be helpful to include that list in your function.

letters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Write your unique_english_letters function here:
def unique_english_letters(word):
  total_sum = 0
  #word = set(word)
  num = []
  for letter in word:
    if letter not in num:
      num.append(letter)
      total_sum += 1
  return total_sum


# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
print(unique_english_letters("mississippi"))
# should print 4
print(unique_english_letters("Apple"))
# should print 4
